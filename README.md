# resin-sense-hat-basic

My first experiment using SenseHAT's LEDs and joystick, powered by [resin.io](https://resin.io/)

## Control

- Use the joystick to move the dot
- Press/hold the joystick button to cycle colors
- Do nothing for 5 seconds to get a rainbow
- (WIP) Use the accelerometer to move the dot
